1. To create a new branch:

	git branch [new_branch_name]

2. To switch from the default branch (master/main) to the new branch:

	git checkout [new_branch_name]

3. To add the modified file:

	git add [modified_file]

4. To commit the modified file:

	git commit -m "committing changes"       {The commit message should be meaningful and concise}

5. To push the new branch to Github:

	git push -u origin [new_branch_name]

Now in Github we can see 2 branches in our project, one is our default branch where we cannot view the change whereas another is our new branch where we can see the change.

6. To switch from the new branch to the default branch:

	git checkout [master/main]
	
7. To merge the new branch to the default branch:

	git merge [new_branch_name]

8. 	git push origin [master/main]

Now we can view that change in our default (master/main) branch.
